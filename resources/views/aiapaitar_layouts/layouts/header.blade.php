					<p class="mb-5"style="color:black;">
						It is important to register your trademark in each country where your business is operating or is likely to expand to avoid losing ownership of your trademark if it was registered by someone else prior to you. 
						All the GCC countries including Saudi Arabia and most countries over the world are first to file system which means that ownership of trademark is given to the individual who registered the trademark first and not to the one who use trademark first.
						Obtaining the trademark registration certificate in particular country means that you are the only one who can use this trademark to identify and distinguish your  goods or services and give you also the right  to prevent other from using identical or similar trademarks in the country of registration.
