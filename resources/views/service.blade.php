											<p class="lead">Trademark Overview</p>
											<p style="text-align: justify;">Most countries over the world are first to file system which means that ownership of a trademark is given to the applicant who registers losing ownership of your trademark if it was registered by someone else prior to you. Obtaining the trademark registration certificate in a particular country means that you are the only one who can use this trademark to identify and distinguish your goods or services and gives you also the right to prevent others from using identical or similar trademarks in a country of registration. Usually, enterprises are willing to choose trademarks that reflect the nature of their goods or services. Although this is a valid target, direct description of products or services lowers the strength and exclusivity of trademark. Our advice on trademark selection will enable you to choose a strong and exclusive trademark that provides the same desired identification to your goods and services. We also examine the validity of the trademark according to the official language of the country in question. Madrid Protocol : provides for filing a single international trademark application before any of the member states and provides protection of the mark to all signatory of the Madrid Protocol. There are presently 91 contracting states to the Madrid Protocol. Madrid Agreement : provides for filing a single international Trademark application before any of the member states and provides protection of the mark to all signatory of the Madrid Agreement. There are presently 56 contracting states to the Madrid Agreement. Paris Convention : filing trademark in member countries provide the applicant the right of 6 months period to claim priority from the original trademark application. There are presently 173 contracting states of Paris Convention.</p>

											<h3>Trademark Infringment</h3>
											<p style="text-align: justify;">Infringement occurs if another business use or register an identical or similar trademark to yours in the same country of registration. The similarity between the two trademarks shall be enough to create customer confusion. You may need our law firm to file a lawsuit in the appropriate jurisdiction to prevent harmful effects of the infringer activities.

In Saudi Arabia for example, the Administrative Court (formerly was called Board of Grievance) is the court in charge of trademark infringement disputes.</p>
